# First Projects

Let's look at the [MakeCode Editor](https://makecode.microbit.org) to see how it works. 

The first thing to notice is that the screen has three sections. 

<img src="./mb_editor.png" width="600px" >

<div style="clear: both;"></div>

<div style="float: left; width: 28%; box-sizing: border-box; padding: 10px;">
    <p>On the left, is an "Emulator", which shows what your microbit will do
    after you download the program to it.</p>
</div>
<div style="float: left; width: 28%; box-sizing: border-box; padding: 10px;">
    <p>In the middle, is the list of blocks. You can click on the block
    categories to get a list of blocks of that color, then drag the blocks
    into the program area.</p>
</div>
<div style="float: left; width: 28%; box-sizing: border-box; padding: 10px;">
    <p>On the right is the program area, where you will build your program out of blocks.</p>
</div>
<div style="clear: both;"></div>


Open some of the block groups in the middle. For instance, click on the <img
style="vertical-align:middle" src="/HourofMicrobit/assets/input.png"
height="25px" > button. Notice that all of the blocks are like puzzle pieces.
The shapes will tell you where you can fit one block to another, and the
colors will tell you what block group to click on. 


## Happy Sad

Lets try to make a simple program that is like the flashing heart, but
flashes happy and sad. 

First, create a new project: Click on <img style="vertical-align:middle"
src="./microbit.png" height="25px" > at the top of the
screen, then the  purple "+ New Project" box. 

After you have a new editor window. Look at the colors in the program below to find the right blocks, then drag them to the program area. Drag them to hook them up.

Once your program looks like the image above, look in the Emulator pane to see if there are happy and sad faces. If there are, click the purple "Download" button to download your program. 


## Dice

Try this dice program next.

## Timer

This program works a bit like a stop watch. Read the program first and try
to figure out how it will work. Then build it and try it out.
