# Easier Flapping

Flappy Bird is really, really hard!  Load [Flappy Bird](https://makecode.com/_Lq9T6JVJp269) and try to make it easier. 

::: details Hint


Somethings you can try to make the game easier: 

* Reduce the acelleration
* Reduce the Y velocity when a button is pressed
* Make the A button move up and the B button move down, instead of making the bird flap

Look at the  [Eat the Fruit](https://makecode.com/_bP03bACK60ac) game to see how the player is moved
