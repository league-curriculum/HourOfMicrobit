First, click on the <img style="vertical-align:middle" src="./sign_in.png" height="25px" > button in the upper-right to create an account. 


To Load your first program, click on the Import button, which looks like this: <img style="vertical-align:middle" src="./import_button.png" height="25px" >

In the import window, click on the middle box, "Import URL...."


Then, enter this URL:

```

Now, click on the purple "Download" button at the bottom of the screen, and follow the instructions for downloading the program to your Micro:bit.
